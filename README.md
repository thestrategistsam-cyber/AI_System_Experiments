# AI System Experiments

This repository is a collection of independent AI experiments, data workflows, and system-building projects.

## About Me
I explore AI, tech, and systems independently — building frameworks, testing ideas, and learning by doing. I collaborate only with minds that solve problems, not chase titles.

## Current Focus
- AI-driven workflow automation
- Human+AI hybrid frameworks
- Data collection & experimentation
- Independent system prototypes

## How to Collaborate
I welcome connections with curious, action-oriented thinkers who share a vision for impactful projects. Contact via my profile links.
